Vicente:

>•	For these specific chemicals/periods, conjugated concentrations were used for associations reported in the main manuscript, while associations with both total and conjugated concentrations were reported in the supplementary material.  
•	We also computed the molar sum of parabens (methyl-, ethyl- and propyl-paraben) to limit the number of statistical tests.  
•	For the main associations observed with molar sums (∑Parabens, ∑DEHP, ∑DiNP and ∑DINCH), a sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the individual effect of each paraben or phthalate metabolite contained in the sum.
